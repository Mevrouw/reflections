What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a .git file is added to you directory so you can start adding commits. Git needs to know about this directory before it can start saving versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It helps making commits more logical, as you get to chose which file you want to b	e a part of the commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	It allows you to add only the file(s) that belong to the described.

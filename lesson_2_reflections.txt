What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a .git file is added to you directory so you can start adding commits. Git needs to know about this directory before it can start saving versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It helps making commits more logical, as you get to chose which file you want to be a part of the commit.
